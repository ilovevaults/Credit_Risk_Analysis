# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to evaulate the creditcard data from LendingClub using six different types of models where four of them are algorithms and the other two are both machine learning models. By using these six methods we can predict the credit risk of each person from the creditcard data. Then we will compare each method based on accuracy and determine which one will be used to predict credit risk.
## Analysis
### Random Oversampling
Random oversampling is used when the amount of data is insufficient and one method of oversampling is called SMOTE which stands for Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. The purpose of SMOTE is to generate synthetic samples for the minority class which helps with the overfitting problem caused by oversampling
